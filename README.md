DGP Message System

------------------------------------------------------------

Jan. 9th.

- To start off with the day. I have archived the original readme logs to a log#.md file you can read in the past.

- The progression followed the old logs were creating a message application for the website. Thus building a capable logic for forms and applications with the backend. 

- From now on, this will be a subject to log change for archiving. Other than that here will be the continuation of the Angular Front-End updates, minus the random bantering I would usually treat as developer blog/update readme.
