# DGP

- Dec. 29th.

This will be a MEAN stack application website for a shirt printing company called DGP LLC.

- Instead of MySQL I decided to use MongoDB, the generic standard for MEAN stack applications seem to have a similar transition from relationals. 

------------------------------------------------------------

- Jan. 1st.

- Happy news years. Probably just talking to myself on this readme at this point as no one really follows my GitHub ha. But it seems like I should be more weary of my google ninja skills as not all courses are up date teaching how to use certain things. Definitely a doozy learning MongoDB and the shell commands from old courses, but nonetheless learned from Mongoose how to setup a blueprint properly. Saving and fetching is working, just need to implement fetching from the front-end of the application now.

// Lots of debugging and learning from using SQL to learning MongoDB on the go, but it seems to be more enjoyable feeling more native in a Javascript environment.

------------------------------------------------------------

- Jan. 2nd.

- Learned how fetching with MongoDB in manual callbacks and templating.

- Reinforced with NodeJS and MongoDB callbacks. Time to implement some Angular.

------------------------------------------------------------

- Jan. 3rd.

- Added custom models for Angular.
- Added a simple html and css bootstrap template to test models.

------------------------------------------------------------

- Jan. 4th.

- Starting the early morning of 1:28 AM off with some directory structuring. Added seperate components.

- Side banter, got a job offer and extra training out in CA today. Sounds awesome for a new years start! Hopefully this goes well. Wish me luck anyone reading this!

------------------------------------------------------------

- Jan. 5th.

- Didn't really get much code done in the pass couple of days. Excited for the job position that might be a big move! Been looking into the company and it seems like something I can give a shot given how I don't have much field work.

That being said, lets go ahead and add more to the Angular code.

- Added full component setup and connected to module for User and Message.

- Well a new update on the job offer. I aced the the technical interview in record time for immediately having me clearing the stage compared to other candidates apparently, but in the end the company did not take me because I did not have a degree even though I proved able.

- Other than that, reaching 8:43pm and I finally implemented some property binding. This is actually pretty dynamic compared to the more static approach with the interpolation.
