# DGP

- Dec. 29th.

This will be a MEAN stack application website for a shirt printing company called DGP LLC.

- Instead of MySQL I decided to use MongoDB, the generic standard for MEAN stack applications seem to have a similar transition from relationals.

- Happy news years. Probably just talking to myself on this readme at this point as no one really follows my GitHub ha. But it seems like I should be more weary of my google ninja skills as not all courses are up date teaching how to use certain things. Definitely a doozy learning MongoDB and the shell commands from old courses, but nonetheless learned from Mongoose how to setup a blueprint properly. Saving and fetching is working, just need to implement fetching from the front-end of the application now.

// Lots of debugging and learning from using SQL to learning MongoDB on the go, but it seems to be more enjoyable feeling more native in a Javascript environment.

- Learned how fetching with MongoDB in manual callbacks and templating.
